总结:
new guidelines for **tort law** ==explaining several several confusing points.==
名词1 + 定语1(介词+名词2) +  定语2 + 定语3
绝大多数情况下 定语2和3都是在修饰名词1的.


#### (二) 状语
英语中的状语的位置是不固定的.
1. 副词
2. 现在分词短语
    a. ==现在分词==+名词, 
    b. ==现在分词==+介词+名词,

collections.

7. ==To those== who are unware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments,

11. He has elected ==as his primary duty and pleasure in life== the activity of thinking in
a Socratic way 
动词+介词1+名词1+介词2+名词2+名词3



#### (三) 同位语
同位语: 在一个名词或者句子后出现的起解释和说明作用的另一个**名词结构**,为前一个名词或句子的同位语.
同位语的作用是为了使整个句子的表达更加正式和多样化.

**同位语存在的模式(以下A和B都是名词):**

1. A, B;
    ==Michael, head of digital media, ==thinks the success of the new fair will depend on whether it can build a brand.
2. A--B--;
    The American Law Institute--a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight--
    issued new guidelines for tort law.
    美国法律研究院--它由一群举足轻重的分析家,律师,以及学者组成, 颁布了侵犯行为法的新纲要.
3. A or B;
    ==The history of clinical nutrition, or the study of the relationship between health and how the body takes in and utilizes food substances,== can be divided into four distinct eras.
    研究健康和身体如何吸收并利用食物成分之间关系的学科被称为临床营养学,它的历史可以被分为四个不同的阶段.
    将同位语提前翻译,被其修饰的名词用代词代替.
4. A of B;
    * The bidding right of the Olympic Games of 2008 goes to the ==city of Beijing.==
    * 比如: the disease of cancer,癌症; the machine of computer,电脑
    * 上义词(宽泛), 下义词(特指), beijing, cancer, computer都是下义词, city,disease, machine是上义词
5. 句子"--"或","后出现一个名词(名词前后可出现修饰成分)
    * The court supported the medical principle of "double effect", ==as a centuries-old moral principle.==
    法庭支持"双重效果"的医学原则, 这是一个历史悠久的道德原则. 将同位语翻译为一个完整的句子
    是"double effects"的同位语
    * Robots will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for
    themselves--==goals that pose a real challenge.==
    机器人将必须在更少的人类监管下运作,并至少能由自己做几个决定, 这些目标才真正具有挑战性.
    是整个句子的同位语

**同位语的翻译方法**
1. 将同位语提前翻译,被其修饰的名词用代词替代
2. 将同位语翻译为一个完整的句子
3. 将同位语从句翻译为"即", 或者用":"



#### (四) 插入语
插入语的作用: 为了增加句子表达的多样性,在英语中**任何成分都可用两个逗号或破折号隔开成为插入成分**,插入语在很多时候并不是一个独立的语法成分.

**插入语的构成成分:**
1. 插入语可以是一个词,一个短语,也可以是一个句子.
2. 插入语两边用逗号与其他成分隔开
3. 插入语最好放在主语之后,以便掌握


**插入语的模式:**
1. 副词插入语(frankly, especially, fortunately, indeed, however)
    * Tourism, frankly, may promote the mutual understanding among nations. 坦率来说,旅游可以促进国家之间的相互了解.
2. 短语插入语
    * generally speaking(总的来说), to tell the truth(说实话), in a sense(在某种意义上讲),
    in a word(总而言之), strange to say(说来奇怪)
    * Parents, in a word, should never lose sight of the side-effects of computer games on their children.总而
    言之, 家长不该忽视电脑游戏对小孩的副作用.
3. 短句插入语(I suppose, as I see it, I believe, what is important(重要的是))
    * Environment, what is important, has a far-reaching influence on one's personality. 重要的是,环境对人的
    性格有着深远的影响.
4. 万能插入语:rather than(而不是)
    * I, rather than any one else, am, rather than was, the best rather than good, teacher, rather than policeman.

5. 一些相对特殊的插入语
    * to some extent从一定程度上讲
    * at length终于,最后,详细地
    * at the mercy of 在...的支配下, 任...摆布


## 第二节. 复合句障碍的识别和处理

### 一. 复合句的定义及障碍的识别
复合句的定义: 含有一套以上的主谓结构且句子中有的成分是由句子构成的.从本质上来讲,一个复合句其实就是由
简单句1, 简单句2,一直到简单句n的一个集合,简单句组合成复合句最重要的两个要素是**连接词**和**主句专一原则**.

**复合句连接词的分类:**
1. 关系代词: what, which, who, whom, as, what等
2. 关系连词: that, when, where, why, how等
3. 标点符号: 冒号和破折号,分号
4. 并列连词: and, or, but等

### 二. 两种复合句类型
复合句的关联方式可以分为两大类:
1. 关系代词,关系连词以及冒号和破折号所链接的分句之间关系是主从或从属关系, 这样的复合句被称为==主从复合句==
2. 并列连词和分号所连接的分句间的关系为并列关系,这样的复合句被称为==并列复合句==.
    * He drank beer, and it made him fat.

**主从复合句:**
1. 名词性从句
    * 主语从句 
    * 宾语从句
    * 表语从句
    * 同位语从句
2. 形容词性从句(定语从句)
3. 副词性从句(状语从句)



**主从复合句的主句专一原则:**
1. 一个句子中只能有一个主句,主句中没有连接词
2. 一个句子中有n个分句,则只有n-1个连接词,
    because 和so不能连用, although和but不能连用,就是由于在一个句子中如果只有两个分句, 却同时使用了because 和so的话,就违背了主句专一原则.

#### (一)主语从句结构识别:
1. 关系连词+句子+动词
    * ==That== **the seas are being over finished** has been known for years. 数年来, 人们一直知道,海洋被过度捕捞了
    * ==That== **the plates are moving** is beyond dispute.人们并不都认为板块是移动的.
    * ==What== **happened on the Guang Ming Ding** will be forever etched in Zhang Wuji's memory.在光明顶发生的一切被永远地印在了张无忌的记忆中
2. it+be动词+形容词/名词短语+关系连词+句子
    * it is clear that...很显然
    * it is possible that...很可能
    * it is likely that...很可能
    * it is natural that...很自然
    * it is certain that... 可以确定
    * it is strange that... 奇怪的是
    * it is fortunate that...幸运的是
    * it is necessary that...有必要的是

    * it is a pity that... 可惜的是
    * it is a fact that...事实是
    * it is good news that... 真是个好消息
    * it is a good thing that... 真是件好事
    * it is no wonder that... 难怪...
    * it is a shame that...遗憾的是
    * it is an honour that... 真荣幸...
    * it is common knowledge that... ...是常识
    * it is my belief that...  我相信
    * it is a miracle that... ...真是奇迹

3. it+不及物动词+that
    * it seems that...    似乎...
    * it follows that...  因此...
    * it happens that...  碰巧...
    * it turns out that... 结果...

















#### (二)宾语从句结构识别:
1. 动词+连接词+句子
    * I have ==learned== **that** ==love, not time, heals all wounds.== 我一直觉得是爱而不是时间治愈了所有的伤痛
2. 动词+宾语+连接词+句子
    * Little Monster ==assured== **Ultraman** ==that== **he had no intention of offending him.**
3. 介词+连接词+句子
    * "The test of any democratic society," he wrote in a Wall Street journal column that, "lies not ==in== **how** ==well it can control expression== but in **whether** ==it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible  latitude.==" 他在《华尔街日报》的一个专栏找那个写道： 对于任何民主社会的检验不在于它能多么有效地控制言论的自由表达，而在于它能否最大限度地赋予思想自由和表达自由。
    * wrote为主句的谓语动词, in a Wall Street Journal为整个句子的状语. that引导宾语从句
    * 在宾语从句中, 主语为the test, 动词为lies, 介词in后面出现两个连接词how和whether,分别引导两个句子作宾语

4. 动词+it(形式宾语)+宾补+连接词+句子
    * we must ==make== **it** ==clear== **that** ==the parties involved are to make every effort to curb the pollution.== 我们必须强调清楚, 有关方面应该尽一切努力治理污染.
    * 宾语其实是that之后的句子,用it代替, 所以it是形式宾语.




#### (三)表语从句结构识别:
1. 系动词+ 连接词+句子
    * the reason for my return ==is== **that** ==I left my keys behind.==
    * The trouble ==is== **that** ==part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend.==问题是最近的加速发展部分是由于商业圈在这个时间段通常发生的反弹,所以这并不构成潜在趋势复苏的最终证据
    * 本句中有一个由that引导的很长的表语从句,从句由两个分句组成,第一个分句中又有一个that引导的定语从句修饰rebound,第二个分句与第一个分句有共同的主语part of the recent acceleration.
    * 这样我们可以得到句子的主干部分: the trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to rebound and is not conclusive evidence.


#### (四)同位语从句结构识别:
1. 名词+连接词+句子
    I have a ==dream== **that** ==one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed--we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.== 
    我有一个梦想,有一天,这个国家可以站立起来兑现它信条的真正含义:我们认为以下的真理是不言自明的, 那就是人人生而平等.

    I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
    我有一个梦想,有一天, 在佐治亚的红山上,曾经的奴隶和奴隶主的孩子们能以兄弟之名同席而坐.

    I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
    我有一个梦想, 有一天,即使是密西西比州,一个充满不公平和压迫的州,也能变成自由和公平的绿洲

    I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
    我有一个梦想,有一天,我的四个孩子能生活在这样的一个国度中,在那里他们不会由于肤色而被人评判,而是由于他们的品行.

    dream后面由that引导的句子就是一个同位语从句,常见的连词就是that, 这里的that是一个连词, 和定语从句中的that的代词词性是不一样的






















































































#### (五)定语从句结构识别:
1. 名词+连接词+句子
2. 句子+连接词+句子
    在这种结构中连接词前面一定要出现逗号,这种结构叫非限定性定语从句.
    Kevin gave us a wonderful training course, which left us a deep impression.


**定语从句的连接词**
1. 关系代词: who whom that which as whose
2. 关系连词: when where why how
3. 介词+关系代词: as和that以及who一般不能接到介词后引导句子.


**处理方法:** 前置和拆分
1. 前置: 适用于比较短和起修饰限定作用的定语从句
    * The sun rises that looks beautiful.看起来很漂亮的太阳升起来了, 这样却不太适合中文的表达习惯
2. 拆分: 一些定语从句用于连接句子,因此可以把定语从句从整个句子中独立拆分出来单独成为一个句子,这种处理方法的关键是找到连接词, 拆分点就是连接词.对于"介词+连接词"引导的定语从句,拆分点在介词处.
    * A poem line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Buglgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river.
    * 拆分点是off, which指代bridge
        a) A poem line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Buglgarian officer on a bridge.
        b) they both fall off the bridge into the river.
        这首诗描述了一个土耳其军官和一个保加利亚军官在桥上格斗,他们从这座桥上掉了下去, 掉进了河里.
    * Man is born as a blank sheet of paper on which each culture writes its text.
    * 拆分点是on, which指代paper
        a) Man is born as a blank sheet of paper.
        b) each culture writes its text on the paper.
        人生下来就是一张白纸,每种文化都在这张纸上书写着自己的文字.
    * The sun rises that looks beautiful. 太阳升起来了,看起来很漂亮.

**作用:**
    * 修饰和限定名词
    * 连接两个具有共同名词的句子
        I have three books of which the red one is my favorite.
        定语从句由of which引导, 但是这个句子并不是在修饰和限定前面的单词books,这个句子其实是由两个句子合并形成的.
        a) I have three books. 
        b) The red one of those books is my favorite.
        这两个句子有共同的名词books, 这样就可以合写成一个句子,此时就用到了定语从句中的第二个作用:连接两个具有共同名词的句子.把第二个句子中的those books 替换成能连接两个句子的关系代词which, 这样就产生了如下这个句子:I have three books, the red one of which is my favorite. 为了让整个句子更加紧凑就把of which提到了books后面,进而形成了刚才的那个句子.
    * 表示因果逻辑关系
        * I love this girl who is beautiful. 
        这句话可以把who引导的定语从句看成是对girl的修饰和解释, 在很多时候也可以看成是表示因果关系,从翻译上就可以表现出来:(1)我喜欢这个漂亮的姑娘. (2) 我喜欢这个姑娘,因为她漂亮.

        * Ameriaca and Ameriacans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economics the war had destroed.
        美国和美国人的繁荣程度超越了欧洲人和亚洲人的梦想,他们的经济被战争摧毁了.

**一些练习:**
1. 用定语从句合并成一个句子
    a) The ambition must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired.
    b) The educated is not least among them.

    The ambition must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired and among whom the educated is not least.雄心壮志必须被这样的一些人高度认同,他们自己就是被人尊敬的,并且在他们当中受教育的并不是少数.

2. 拆分句子
    * There is something by virtue of which man is man. 存在一种特性,人之所以为人就是这种特性.

    a) There is something.
    b) man is man by virtue of this thing.

    by virtue of 固定搭配,凭借...的力量


#### (六)状语从句
结构识别: 句子+连接词+句子

处理方法:剥离

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life", and making the alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards than financed success and social status.
我已经发现,放弃那种"为生活忙碌"的人生信条并转而追求比较悠闲的生活带给你的回报远远大于经济的成功和社会地位的提升. 或许凯尔希在积劳重负之后公开辞去她在《女友》杂志社的编辑职位之后也会有如此发现。

* as引导状语从句, 然后剥离, 句子主干为: I have discovered that...
* brings with it greater rewards...
    with it 是状语, 动词+介词+名词1+名词2. 介词+名词1就是状语.所以见到两个名词挨在一起要注意.
* as引导的状语从句中的动词discover和主句中的discover是相同的,为了表达的简洁省略了动词discover, 原句应该是 as perhaps Kelsey will discover after...


### 三. 复合句障碍的处理
#### (一). 层次化句子阅读法
#### (二). 完整主干法
**缘起: **
(1) 主谓隔离: 句子的主语和谓语之间放入定语或者插入语, 同位语修饰主语
(2) 谓宾隔离: 谓语和宾语之间会加入状语或插入语以增加句子的多变性.

**解决之道:**
(1)句子开头的第一个独立名词(前面没有出现介词或关联词)就是句子的主语,应该优先寻找和主语相对应的动词.
(2)动词确定后应该确定后面的结构,如果在动词和宾语之间有其他的成分,最好跳读.

**例句:**
1. The fact that artisans, who were looked on as mechannics or skilled workers in the eighteenth century, are frequently considered artists today is directly attributable to the Arts and Crafts movement of the nineteenth century. 

18世纪被认为是机械师或熟练工人的人, 在今天通常被当作艺术家, 这一事实可以直接归因于19世纪的工艺运动.
句子主干: the fact is directly attributable to the Arts and Crafts movement of the nineteenth century.


2. Anyone who has handled a fossilized bone knows that it is usually not exactly like its modern counterpart, the most obvious difference being that it is often much heavier.
任何一个处理过化石骨头的人都知道化石骨头通常和现代人的骨头都不一样,其中最大的不同就是这种骨头通常会重很多.

句子主语为开头的第一个独立名词anyone, 动词为knows, 宾语从句为it is usually not exactly like its modern counterpart; who has handleda fossilized bone为定语从句修饰主语anyone
the most obvious difference being that it is often much heavier为==独立主格结构==,可以还原为: the most obvious difference is that it is often much heavier.





# 第二章 长难句翻译技巧点拨
## 第一节 定语从句翻译技巧
### 一. 前置译法
如果一个定语从句在句子的作用是修饰和限定名词,那么通常就采取译为前置定语的方法
1. Water, which is a clear liquid, has many uses.
水是一种清澈的液体,有很多用途.

2. Objects that do not transfer light cause shadows.
不透光的物体会造成阴影

3. Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, conveniences and amusements of human life.
人是富是贫,要看他能获得生活必需品,舒适品和娱乐品的程度如何.

前置译法进阶1:
如果定语从句中的谓语不含有具体意义,可省译从句中的谓语
4. the purposes for which electricity is used are numerous.
电的用途很多.

5. He is the man which he was. 
他还是过去那个老样子

6. We have arrived at the same conclusion as they have.
我们得出了与他们一样的结论

前置译法进阶2:
可将定语从句提到主语之前翻译, 用来说明情况,而不用作所修饰名词的定语.
7. I suffered agonies that no one suspected. 
谁也想不到,我内心经历了多么大的痛苦.

8. The police capitulated on the morning of the day when I volunteered to defy them.
那天上午我主动同警察对抗, 他们却投降了.

9. There are also great advantages that come from the variety of culture brought by settlers from other lands.
移民从各地带来了多种文化, 产生了极大的好处.

10. Here we shall discuss only such factors ==as== may cause distortions of the signal.
这里我们只讨论可能引起信号失真的那些因素.

### 二. 后置译法
很多定语从句都是为了连接两个具有共同名词的句子而存在的,因此在翻译时最好分为两个分句,而对于起限定作用的定语从句, 如果结构较为复杂,句子太长,无法译成前置的定语,最好就译成一个后置的并列分句.
1. Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power.
我们的反恐战争是一场意志力的较量,在这场较量中,不屈不挠的精神就是力量.

2. I propose to offer a theory which, as far as I am aware, has not previously been set forth, that only those animals capable of speech are capable of laughter, and that therefore man, being the only animal that speaks, is the only animal that laughs.
我试图提出一种理论,据我所知, 这种理论还未曾有人提出过,那就是:只有能说话的动物才会笑. 人是唯一能说话的动物,所以也是唯一会笑的动物.

后置译法进阶1:
结构较复杂的定语从句常汉译成后置的并列分句,在多数情况下,要重译先行词,有时即便句子不长,出于某种原因需要强调先行词,也需重译先行词.
3. Two factors are particularly important in the history of inventions. One is the part played by inspiration, which can be far more vital than that of careful research.
在发明史上有两个因素特别重要,其中之一是灵感的作用,这可能比苦心钻研的作用要重要得多.

4. Days and nights are very long on the moon, where one day is as long as two weeks on the earth. 
在月亮上,白天和黑夜都很长, 月亮上的一天等于地球上的两周.

后置译法进阶2:
有些定语从句汉译成后置分句,但可不重译先行词,译文仍然符合汉语习惯
5. I was contemptuously dismissed as a novice who had not read the great first volume of Marx's Das Capital.
他们轻蔑地说我是个新手,连马克思的《资本论》这一卷这部重要的著作也没读过。

6. Both picnics and barbeque are friendly, informal social events that offer an opportunity to enjoy a meal outside in pleasant surroundings.
野餐和烧烤都是友情洋溢,不拘礼节的社交活动,可以让大家在户外怡情的环境里高高兴兴地美餐一顿.

7. They contain the value of certain quantity of labour which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity.
他们包含着一定量劳动的价值,我们就用这一定量的劳动去同假定在当时包含着同量劳动的价值的东西交换.

8. Vicky was an energetic student who laboured at her dissertation on a little-known 14th century poet.
维姬是个精力充沛的学生,努力地撰写那篇论述14世纪一位不为人熟悉的诗人的学位论文

9. we cannot have an intuitive knowledge that shall extend itself to all our ideas, and all that we would know about them.
我们不能有一种直观的知识,可以延伸到我们的一切观念以及我们关于观念所想知道的一切.


### 三. 转换译法
1. I'm not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give, or have a theoretical knowledge of that proof, but of the ordinary news-paper-reading citizens, such as you or me.
我说的不是数千位天文学家,地理学家之类的人,因为他们可以用观察到的事实或用理论上的依据来证实这一点,我指的是如同你我一样只看报纸的普通读者.
who=because they

2. The increasing complexities of microsurgery, laser technology, arthroscopy and who knows what next demand understanding and competence in techniques that require educationally sound training for the future orthopaedist.

## 第二节 分译、合译技巧
### 一. 分译技巧的点拨

英语中长句较多，句子中的修饰语多且长，使句子结构复杂，所以英译汉时，不能照样克隆复制，而是要根据汉语语法的特点，灵活处理，切分就是一种常用的方法，是指把英语中的长句分解成两个或两个以上的句子。它通常包括单词分译，短语分译和句子分译这三种情况。
**单词分译：**
单词分译是指把原文中的一个单词拆译成一个小句或句子。采用单词分译还有两个目的：一个是为了句法上的需要，由于一些单词在搭配，词义等方面的特点，直译会使句子生硬晦涩，翻译腔十足，而把某个单词分译却能使句子通顺，且不损害原意。二是为了修饰上的需要，如加强语气，突出重点等。英语中的名词，动词，形容词和副词等都可分译。

1. We recognize that China's long-term modernization program understandably and necessarily emphasizes economic growth.
我们认识到,中国的长期现代化建设以发展经济为重心,这是可以理解的,也是必要的.

2. Then and there he named the startled General lying wounded on his cot the new Commander in Chief of the Airforce.
就在当时当地他任命这位躺在榻上治伤的将军为空军总司令,使这位将军大吃一惊.

3. A movie of me leaving that foxhole would look like a shell leaving a rifle.
我离开那个散兵坑的速度之快,要是拍成电影的话,会像出膛的子弹一样.

4. Yet it is painfully apparent that millions of Americans who would never think of themselves as law-breakers, let alone criminals, are taking increasing liberties with the legal codes that are designed to protect and nourish their society.

5. At present people have a tendency to choose the safety of the middle-ground reply.
现在人们都倾向于采取不偏不倚的态度来回答问题,因为它安全,不招风险.

6. Auntie Julia vainly asked each of her neighbors in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.
茱莉娅姨妈接连向坐在旁边的人打听加布里埃尔刚才说了些什么, 却没有问出个所以然来.

**短语分译**
短语分译是指把原文中的一个短语分译成一个句子. 名词短语,分词短语,介词短语等通常都阔以分译成句.
1. These cheerful little trams, dating back to 1873, chug and sway up the  towering hills with bells ringing and people hanging from every opening.
这些令人欢快的小缆车建于1873,咔嚓咔嚓摇摆这爬上高耸的山峦,车上铃儿叮当做响, 每个窗口都是人(介词短语分译)

2. The military is forbiden to kill the vessel, a relatively easy task.

3. invitingly green Angel Island, once a military installation, contains meandering trails and picnic spots ideal for a day's excursion.
迷人的天使岛郁郁葱葱,小径蜿蜒,是一日游的理想野餐场所.但在过去它确实一个军事基地.


**句子分译**
句子分译可以分为简单句的分译,并列复合句的分译,主从复合句的分译以及其他情况的分译.
(1) 简单句的分译
1. Daybreak comes with thick mist and drizzle. 
黎明时分,大雾弥漫,细雨霏霏.

2. But another round of war in the region clearly would put strains on international relations.
但是如果该地区再次发生战争,显然会使国际关系处于紧张状态.

(3) 主从复合句的分译
英语复合句汉译时常在分句连接处加以切分,分译成两个或两个以上的句子.
1. One day, while out on the bleak moors, Pip is startled by a hulking, menacing man who threatens him if he does not bring him some food immediately.
有一天, 匹普在阴冷的荒原上游荡时, 一个魁梧,凶狠的男子把他吓了一跳.这个男子威胁他,让他立即为他送些食物来(在who引导的从句前切分)

1905年,这一切都宣告结束了.在一次暴动中,妈妈的几个同事牺牲了,医疗队也解散了.(在when处切分)

(4) 其他情况的分译
有些长句的翻译需要根据具体情况,意群的分布等进行灵活处理,合理切分,使译文层次分明,观点明确.

1. suddenly the door bursts open and the Time Traveler appears, dirty, disheveled, and bedraggled, with a nasty cut on his chin.
突然, 门猛地开了,时间旅行家出现了. 他肮脏不堪,衣冠不整,满身都是泥, 下巴被严重划伤.(在appear后切分)

等到男人走过来时,女人和孩子早已挨着地上铺开的桌布边坐好了.男人身穿上班穿的套装和背心,系着领带,戴着帽子,似乎希望路上会遇到什么人似的.(在分词短语前切分)







### 二. 合译技巧的点拨
比较短的英语句子,也需要合译
**简单句的合译**
1. She is intelligent, ambitious and hard-working. She is also good at solving problems.
她才智过人,雄心勃勃,工作努力,还善于解决问题.

2. The door was unlocked. She went inside and sat in a stupor. She was near colapse, barely able to move her swollen feet.
门没锁,她走了进去,呆呆地坐了下来,极度的衰弱几乎使得她无力挪动那红肿的双脚.

4. The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt.
每次诊断似乎都和我所预想的完全相符.








# 第三章 从非谓语动词到特殊句式
## 第一节 非谓语动词和独立主格
### 一. 非谓语动词
非谓语动词,顾名思义就是在句子中充当谓语以外的其他成分,探究其本质可以发现:
* 充当主语,宾语或表语,其目的是实现动词的名词化表达
* 充当定语, 目的是代替起修饰限定作用的定语从句
* 充当状语, 目的是将两个具有共同主语的句子写成一个句子

1. 作主语,宾语和表语
to say that the child learns by imitation and that the way to teach is to set a good example is a bit oversimplified.
认为孩子学习是靠模仿,教育的方式就是树立榜样,这些说法都过于简单了.
句子主干是: To say... is a bit oversimplified. 这个句子的难点就在于充当主语的是一个动词不定式:to say that the child learns by imitation and that the way to teach is to set a good example;且在这个不定式中出现了两个并列的宾语从句作say的宾语,加大了理解的难度.the child learns by imitation为第一个宾语从句, the way to teach is to set a good example为第二个宾语从句.


2. 非谓语动词作定语
a woman picking the blackberry可以改写成:
a woman who is picking the blackberry.

3. 非谓语动词作状语
(1)非谓语动词作状语
a) He reads carefully
b) He forgets the time for lunch.
这两个句子的特点是主语相同,把这两个句子连成一个句子可以变成:
Reading carefully, he forgets the time for lunch.
They stood by the roadside talking about the plan.

a) we are faced with difficulties.
b) we must try to overcome them.
Faced with difficulties, we must try to overcome them.   

规则:
两个主语相同的句子去掉一个主语,然后将动词作如下变化:
be动词变为being,do动词变为doing(即主动结构加-ing), 被动语态变为done(即去掉be动词)

例题:
a) In the sunshine stands a flower.
b) It grows vigorously.

In the sunshine stands a flower, growing vigorously.


a) I am a teacher.
b) I give classes.

I, being a teacher, give classes.  演变成:
I,  a teacher, give classes.  (同位语结构)

(2)非谓语动词作状语表原因
非谓语作状语时,有充当原因或结果的可能性
1. Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to anticipate every possible accident.
语义层面: 公司感受到了威胁,通过书写冗长的警示标签作为回应,尝试着希望能预测到每一起可能的事故.
逻辑层面: 
原因: 感受到了威胁
结果: 写警告作为回应
表示因果的手段:非谓语动词作状语.

2. Fed up with increasing rates, customers, notably chemical, coal, and agribusiness companies, are complaining that these are evidence that the railroads are abusing their market power.
语义层面: 客户们,特别是化工,煤炭和农业公司,已经受够了价格的上涨,他们抱怨道: 这些就是铁路部门正在滥用其市场权利的证据
逻辑层面: 
原因: 受够了价格的上涨
结果: 他们开始抱怨.
表示因果的手段:非谓语动词作状语.

3. Observers doubt that this aggressive target that some 40% of Prada's revenues in America will come from the Internet in 5 years is realistic, noting that it currently sells only bags, wallets and other accessories online, not its main clothing and footwear collections.
语义层面: 五年内,普拉达在美国的收入有大约40%将来自网络,观察者怀疑这一激进的目标是否现实,因为他们注意到普拉达当下在网上只卖箱包,钱夹和其他的一些饰品,而不是其主流的衣服和鞋款系列.
逻辑层面: 
原因: 观察者注意到一些事实
结果: 观察者怀疑这一目标是否现实.
表示因果的手段:非谓语动词作状语.

4. Founded in 1694, the Bank of England has centuries of experience in dealing with financial troubles.
语义层面: 英格兰银行成立于1694年,在应对金融困境方面已经有几百年的经验了
逻辑层面: 
原因: 成立于1964年
结果: 有几百年应对金融困境的经验
表示因果的手段:非谓语动词作状语.























### 二. 独立主格
独立主格的由来: 独立主格在英语中存在的主要价值还是由语言简洁的要求决定的.独立主格的产生就是从作状语开始的
独立主格结构为两个句子在主语不同的情况下提供了将其合并为一个句子的可能,可通过简单的例子来了解它的由来.
a) It is hot today.
b) I stay at home.

合并为一个句子: It being hot taday, I stay at home.
同样, being 也是可以被省略的,而且常常还会在it being hot today之前加上介词with以表示其和一个句子的区别,这样with it being hot today就被称为独立主格结构.

独立主格可以表示以下几种情况:
(1)表示时间
1. The meeting being over, all of us went home. 开完会后我们都回家了.
    the meeting being over相当于when the meeting was over.
2. her work done, she sat down for a cup of tea.她干完了活,坐下来喝茶.
    her work done相当于when her work was done.

(2)表示条件
1. the condition being favorable, he may succeed.若条件有利,她或许能成功.
    the condition being favorable相当于if the condition is favorable.

(3)表示原因
1. there being no taxis, we had to walk. 没有出租车,我们只好步行.
2. He wrapped her up with great care, the night being dark and frosty.夜又黑又冷, 所以他把她裹得严严实实的.
    the night being dark and frosty相当于as the night was dark and frosty

(4)表示伴随情况
1. Almost all metals are good conductors, silver being the best of all.几乎所有的金属都是良导体, 而银则是最好的导体
    这句话相当于Almost all metals are good conductors, and silver is the best of all.


(5)表示补充说明
1. We redoubled our efforts, each man working like two.我们加倍努力, 一个人干两个人的活.
    这句话相当于We redoubled our efforts, and each man works like two.
2. President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns.
布什总统极力将社会保险变为储蓄模式,这样一来退休人员就会将其大部分甚至是所有的有保障的收入换为依靠投资回报的收入.


## 第二节 倒装句和强调句
### 一. 倒装句
#### (一) 部分倒装
(1)部分倒装的定义: 系动词,情态动词或助动词被置于主语前为部分倒装(实义动词位置未发生改变)
(2)部分倒装的识别的还原: 如果在==系动词,情态动词和助动词==后出现名词可以判定为部分倒装.部分倒装的还原也很简单,将系动词,情态动词和助动词还原,助动词有时也需要去掉.
1. Nor did he let the disease stop him from living the kind of life he has always dreamt about.
疾病也没有使他放弃过梦想中的生活
did归位,即he didn't let the disease stop him from living the kind of life he has always dreamt about. 

2. In no country other than Britain, it had been said, can one experience four seasons in the course of a single day.
据说除了英国世界上没有哪个国家能让人在一天中感受到四季变化
can归位, 即It had been said that one can experience four seasons in the course of a single day in no country other than Britain.

3. Only after he had spoken out the word did he realize he had made a big mistake.
只有当他说出那个字后他才意识到自己翻了个大错误.
did归位, He realize he had made a big mistake only after he had spoken out the word.

4. hardly had he arrived when she started somplaining.他刚到,她就开始抱怨.
had归位, 即he had hardly arrived when she started complaining.

以上都是由于某些表示否定和唯一的副词置于句首引起的倒装.

(3) 几种特殊的部分倒装.
**由as 引导的部分倒装句**
1) 由as引导让步状语,和although, though一样,用作"尽管"之意时,可以用于部分倒装句.
hard as he worked, he did not pass the exam.
虽然他很用功, 但还是没及格

2) as表示原因时,为了强调起见,也可以倒装.
Tired as he was, we decided not to disturb him.
因为他太累了, 我们决定不打扰他

3) 等于so时,意义是"也,也是"
She worked hard, so/as did her husband.
她工作很努力,她的丈夫工作也很努力.


**在由"so+adv. /adj. + that"和"such that"引导的结果状语从句中, 句子结构要求用倒装句**
1) so far does light travel that it is difficult for us to imagine its speed.
光能传播如此之远,以至于我们很难想象它的速度.
还原: light travels so far that...

2) So sudden was the attack that we had no time to escape.
攻击如此之快,以至于我们没有时间逃脱

3) So loudly did he speak that even people in the next room could hear him.
他讲话如此大声,以至于隔壁都能听到他说话
还原: He spoke so loudly that...


#### (二) 完全倒装
(1)完全倒装的定义: 动词前后的成分完全倒置(动词的相对位置发生改变)
(2)完全倒装的存在环境:"主系表"到装成"表系主"

1)能够在句子中充当主语和表语的成分
主语: 名词,代词,动词不定式,动名词
表语:形容词,形容词短语,现在分词短语,过去分词短语(以上可以称为形容词性的词),介词短语(方位副词)

2) 系动词的分类:
**状态系动词**: 用来表示主语状态,只有be动词;he is a teacher
**持续系动词**:用来表示主语继续或波爱吃一种状态或态度,主要有keep,rest, remain, stay, lie, stand.
    1. He always keeps silent at meeting.他开会时总保持沉默.
    2. This matter rests a mystery. 此事仍是一个谜
**表"像"系动词**:用来表示"看起来像"这一概念,主要有seem, appear, look
    1. He looks tired. 他看起来很累
    2. He seems (to be) very sad. 他看起来很伤心.
**感官系动词**: 主要有feel,smell, sound, taste
    1. this kind of cloth feels very soft. 这种布手感很软
    2. this flower smells very sweet.这朵花闻起来很香
**变化系动词**: 表示主语变成什么样,主要有become, grow, turn, fall, get, come, run
    1. he became mad after that. 自那之后,他疯了.
    2. She grew rich within a short time. 她没多长时间就富了.

**终止系动词**: 表示主语已终止动作,主要有prove, turn out, 表达"证实"
    1. The rumor proved false.谣言证实有假
    2. The research proved difficult.搜索证实很难
    3. His plan turned out a success. 他的计划终于成功了.

英语系动词的功能主要是把表语(名词,形容词,某些副词,非谓语动词, 介词短语,从句)和它的主语联系在一起,说明主语的属性,特征和状态,它有自己的但不完全的词义,不能在句中独立作谓语,必须和后面的表语一起构成句子的谓语.
常用于倒装的系动词包括: be, come, go, run, walk,lie, crouch, stand, descend, ascend, become.

完全倒装的判断流程
1. 形容词性的词置于句首或介词短语和方位副词置于句首,后紧跟系动词可判定为倒装
    解析: 形容词性的词在句中作定语和表语,而置于句首说明不是作后置定语,后紧跟系动词也说明不是作前置定语,因此只能充当表语;介词短语和方位副词在句中充当状语和表语,后紧跟系动词说明只能充当表语.
2. v.-ing开头的句子,后紧跟复数系动词可判定为倒装.
    解析: v.-ing开头时,通过词本身很难判断出其词性为形容词或动名词,因此只能通过系动词来判定. 如果v.-ing为动名词,那么其系动词就应该是单数,所以如果出现的是复数系动词的话就可以判定为倒装.

3. v.-ing开头的句子,后紧跟单数系动词,后接名词性的词可以判定为倒装.
    解析: v.-ing开头时,系动词为单数,但如果后面是名词性的词,则可能是倒装也可能不是倒装.如:
    a) Playing basketball is an interesting game.(不是倒装)
    b) Playing basketball is my cousin who is from New York.(倒装)


3) 例句:
1. Herein lay the beginning of turn from ignorance to denial of the value of nutritional therapies in medicine.
人们对于医学上营养疗法的价值的认识从无知变为否定,这一转变就是从这里开始的.
解析:herein方位副词表示"在这里"的意思, lay为系动词lie的过去式,可以判定为倒装;
还原: the beginning of turn from ignorance to denial of the value of nutritional therapies in medicine lay herein.

2. Surrounding the column are three sepals and three petals, sometimes easily recognizable as such, often distorted into gorgeous, weired, but always functional shapes.
三个瓣片和三个萼片有时候是这样容易地被认出来,经常被扭曲成了美丽的,奇怪的,但一直是有用的一些形状,这些瓣片和萼片就围绕着这个柱子展开.
解析: surrounding开头,后接复数系动词可以判定为倒装,正常语序为: Three sepals and three petals, sometimes easily recognizable as such, often distorted into gorgeous,weired, but always functional shapes are surrounding the column.
这里倒装的目的是平衡句子结构,使对于主语的修饰更加充分.

3. With the growing prosperity brought on by the Second World War and the economic boom, young people married and established households earlier and began to raise larger families than had their predecessors during the Depression.
由于"二战"后带来的繁荣,以及经济的增长,年轻人和他们大萧条时期的前辈相比结婚更早,生孩子也更早,生的孩子也更多.

解析: 这个句子中的倒装出现在后半句: than had their predecessors during the Depression.这是动态比较所引起的倒装,正常的语序是: than their predecessors during the Depression had.可以看下面的动态比较的例子:
    a) I can run faster than he runs.
    b) I can run faster than he does.
    c) I can run faster than does he.

4. Basic to any understanding of Canada in the 20 years after the Second World War is the country's impressive population growth.
加拿大巨大的人口增长是对"二战"后20年的加拿大的基本理解.

解析: basic to any understanding 是一个形容词短语,在结束的时候紧跟系动词is,因此可以判定为倒装,正常语序应该是: Canada's impressive population growth is basic to any understanding of this country in the 20 years after the Second World War.

5. Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots.
全球分布着超过100个小火山活动区域,地质学家称这些区域为热点.

解析: scattered around the globe为过去分词短语,后接系动词可以判定为倒装,主语为more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots

6. Adding to woman's increased dose of stress chemicals are her increased "opportunities" for stress.
女性承受压力的"机会"增多,使得产生压力的化学物质也随之增长
解析: adding to woman's increased dose of stress chemicals 为v.-ing,而后接复数系动词可以判定为倒装,正常语序为: Woman's increased "opportunities" for stress are adding to her increaded dose of stress chemicals.


7. Among the species of seabirds that use the windswept cliffs of the Atlantic coast of Canada in the summer to mate, lay eggs, and rear their young are common murres, Atlantic puffins, black-legged kittiwakes, and northern gannets.
有一些鸟类会在夏天的时候利用加拿大陡峭的大西洋悬崖来交配,产卵并抚育自己的幼鸟,普通的海雀,大西洋的海鸥,黑腿三趾鸥以及北方的塘鹅就是这样的海鸟.

解析: 句子开头时一个很长的介词短语: among the species of seabirds that use the windswept cliffs of the Atlantic coast of Canada in the summer to mate, lay eggs, and rear their young, 整个部分被其中一个定语从句:hat use the windswept cliffs of the Atlantic coast of Canada in the summer to mate, lay eggs, and rear their young拉长,造成理解上的困难.后紧接系动词are,可以判定为倒装, 其主干语序应该是:Common murres, Atlantic puffins, black-legged kittiwakes, and northern gannets are among the species of seabirds.



8. Most important, perhaps, was that they had all maintained with a certain fidelity the technique and composition consistent with those of America's first popular landscape artist, Thomas Cole, who built a career painting the Catskill Mountain scenery bordering the Hudson River.
他们都坚定地支持者美国第一个流行景观艺术家托马斯*柯尔的技法和构图原则一致的技法和原则,柯尔一直从事着描绘哈德逊河两岸的卡茨基尔山风景的事业

解析: most important为形容词置于句首,后紧接系动词,可以判定为倒装,主干的顺序应该是: That was most important. 而they had all maintained with a certain fidelity the technique and composition consistent with those of America's first popular landscape artist, Thomas Cole, who built a career painting the Catskill Mountain scenery bordering the Hudson River为主语从句


9. Coincident with concerns about the acceleration loss of species and habitats has been a growing appreciation of the importance of biological diversity, the number of species in a particular ecosystem, to the health of the Earth and human well-being.
(翻译时首先将同位语提前翻译)生物多样性是指在一个特定的生态系统中物种的数量,而人们越来越认识到其对于地球健康和人类幸福的重要性,与此同时, 人们也越来越关心物种和其栖息地的加速流失问题.

解析: Coincident with concerns about the acceleration loss of species and habitats 为形容词短语, coincident为形容词,with为介词, concerns为名词, about the accelerating loss of species and habitats 为介词短语修饰concerns为定语; 在形容词短语结束处紧接系动词的完成时has been, 因此可以判定为倒装,而句子主语为a growing appreciation of the importance of biological diversity,同位语:the number of species in a particular ecosystem; to the health of the Earth and human well-being修饰importance,构成一个小结构the importance of A to B(A对于B的重要性)
整个句子的主干就是: coincident with concerns has been a growing appreciation.可以抽象为: Coincident with A has been B.这个句型的关键是: A和B都是动态名词.
这个句型翻译: 随着A,B...或者A...与此同时B.....

用这个结构能写出很多漂亮的句子:
A. 随着中国经济的发展,中国的教育水平由来极大提高.
a) the development of Chinese economy.
b)  the great improvement of education in China.
Coincident with the development of Chinese economy has been the  improvement of education in China.

B. 随着网络的兴起, 电视开始衰落了.(两个动态名词:兴起和衰落)
a) the rise of the technology of the Internet.
b) the decline of the television.

Coincident with the rise of the technology of the Internet has been the decline of the television.

10. Indeed, had it not been for the superb preservation of these fossils, they might well have been classified as dinosaurs.
确实, 如果不是这么完整地保护了这些化石,他们很可能已经被归类为恐龙化石了.

解析: 助动词had置于主语it前,可以判定为部分倒装,此处的倒装是由虚拟条件句中if被省略引起的;整个句子还原就是: indeed, if it had not been for the superb preservation of these fossils, they might well have been classified as dinosaurs.

11. All would be well were reason the only judge in the creationism and evolution debate.
如果理性是创造论和进化论争论中的唯一评判标准的话, 那么所有的事情也都好办了.

解析: 助动词were被提前置于主语reason前, 可以判定为部分倒装;此处倒装的原因是由于虚拟条件中if被省略;句子还原就是: if reason were the only judge in the creationism and evolution debate, all would be well.

12. For example, they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an underprivileged youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.
例如,测试并不能弥补社会不公,因此就不能说明一个物质条件很差的人,如果在更加有利的条件下成长,会有多么能干.

解析: 句子也出现了虚拟语气的倒装: had he grown up under more favorable circumstances, 完整的表达是: if he had grown up under more favorable circumstances. they是指示代词,指代前文的测试; compensate for: 弥补; inequality: 不平等,不公平,不同; underprivileged:贫困的,物质条件差的



### 二. 强调句
(1) 强调句的组成:
it is(was)+被强调部分+that(who)+其他部分

现在时间为is, 过去时间为was, 被强调部分为动词外的任何成分;强调对象为人则用who或者that,强调对象为物时则只能用that,句子的其他成分为正常语序

(2)强调句的处理方法
去掉强调格式后,将被强调部分还原到句子中

1. It was just a decade before this that many drug companies had found their vitamin sales skyrocketing and were quick to supply practicing physicians with generous samples of vitamins and literature extolling the virtue of supplementation for a variety of health-related conditions.
就在这之前的十年,很多医药公司发现他们的维生素销量飞速上升,于是很快就给临床医生提供了大量的维生素样本和一些文字资料,这些资料颂扬了维生素对于各种与健康相关的疾病的补充治疗功能.

解析: 强调格式为: it was...that..., 去掉这个格式之后将just a decade before this还原到句中作状语,句子还原后就为:just a decade before this, many drug companies had found their vitamin sales skyrocketing and were quick to supply practicing physicians with generous samples of vitamins and literature extolling the virtue of supplementation for a variety of health-related conditions.
practicing physicians是临床医生, 执业医师
generous修饰人时是"慷慨的", 修饰物时是"大量的"
literature是"文学", 这里表示"文字材料"
virtue修饰人表示"美德", 但是修饰物则是"功能"的意思
condition常常为"条件", 在医学里面多表示"病情"

# 第四章 比较结构和动态名词
## 第一节 比较结构的讲解(24种)
1. it is not that... but that... 这并不是说...而是说...
it is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the latter is much finner apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than the former.
这不是在衡量个案,也不是在和其他案子作比较,人们对自己的建设和工作方式有不同的原则.但是,后者比前者采用更好的仪器,理所当然地也比前者有更加精确的测量度

2. nothing else than... 完全是,实在是....
(a) What the man said was nothing else than nonsense.
那个人说的话完全是一派胡言

(b)it is nothing else than a blackmail
这简直就是敲竹杠

3. as引导的特殊状语从句,翻译时当做定语从句处理
we hope the measures to control prices, as they have been taken by the government, will succeed.
我们希望政府已经采取的控制物价的措施能取得成功

4. 名词+or+名词 结构中, or后的名词是同位语, 应译为"即...",
Moreover, technology includes techniques, or ways to do things, as well as the machines that may or may not be necessary to apply them.
再者, 除了机器外, 技术还包括技艺,即制作方法,而运用这些技艺并不一定都需要机器

5. more...than...结构有三种译法: than连接肯定形式的从句时,该从句译为否定句; 在比较的基础上表示选择关系时,可译为:"与其说...不如说...", 进行同类比较时,译为"比...更..."
a) the complexity of the human situation and injustice of the social order demand for more fundamental changes in the basic structure of society itself than some politicians are willing to admit in their speeches.
人类社会形势的复杂性和社会制度的不公正性要求对社会基本结构进行彻底变革,而一些政客口头上是很不愿意承认这一点的.

b) It seems that these two branches of science are mutually dependent, and that the so-called division between the pure scientist and the applied scientist is more apparent than real.
看起来这两门学科是相互依存的,因为在理论科学家和应用科学家之间,与其说存在着所谓的区分,不如说这种区分只是表面存在的

c) there are more cars on the roads in summer than in winter.
公路上的汽车夏天比冬天要多.


6. no more...than...与not...any more than...
no more...than...与not...any more than同义, 不可简单地看成more...than的否定形式.具体来说,这一结构可能是带有一定感情色彩的否定形式,也可能是一种较特殊的类比形式,其翻译方法有二:表示同类否定比较时,可以译为"不比....更....", "都...同样不...",表示比喻关系时,可译为"正如...不..., ....也不....."
a) the food on the ship was no better than on any other ship on which Billy had sailed.
这条船上(供应)的食品并不如比利工作过的其他船上的(食品)好.

b) The archaeologists' efforts are not directed at "proving" the correctness of Bible any more than belief in God can be scientifically demonstrated.
正如信仰上帝不能从科学上证明一样,考古学家们的努力也不是要"验证"《圣经》的正确性

c) No one can hold back the tide of revolution any more than a man with a broom can hold a flood that has burst the dam.
任何人都无法阻挡革命的洪流,正如一个人不能拿着扫帚去挡住决堤的洪水一样.

7. not so much...as...与其说....不如说...
Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools.
她们说,科学的发展与其说源于天才伟人的真知灼见,不如说源于改进了的技术和工具等更为普遍的东西.

8. the same...as... 与...相同
you have made the same mistake as last time.
你又犯了和上次一样的错误

9. no less than(no less...than)不亚于, 多达(强调人多);不但....而且..., 简直是,实在是
a) There were no less than one thousand people at the meeting.
到会的有一千多人(有"到会人很多"的含义)

b) There were not less than one thousand people at the meeting.
到会的至少有一千人(没有到会人多人少的含义)
not less than "不少于", 无数量多或少的含义

c) China insists always on the need for self-reliance, no less in economic policies than in making revolutions.
中国始终坚持独立自主,这种坚持不但体现在革命方面,在经济政策方面也是如此.

d) It is no less than blackmail to ask such a high price.
索要如此高价,简直是敲诈.


10. ...other than... 不是....正是....; 除了....外..., 不会是....
a) Reaction other than the desired one often occurs when reactants are brought together.
当这些反应物被放在一起时, 常发生一些我们不希望有的反应.
解析: other than为固定搭配,其义有二:一是"与...不同,而不是...", 二是"除了";可插入名词


b) other woman than Sally would have said nothing.
除了萨利,别的女子就什么也不说了
解析: other than可分写为other...than...,other后可插入名词,than的意思是"除了"


11. nothing but = nothing else than = nothing less than不是别的...正是...(本句型亦为强调判断句)
a) Genius is nothing but labor and diligence.
天才不过是劳动和勤奋而已

b) His failure was due to nothing else than his own carelessness.
他的失败完全是由于他自己的粗心造成的.

c) His negligence was nothing less than criminal.
他的粗心大意无异于犯罪

12. much less=still less更不, 更无
a) I could not agree to, much less participate in such proceedings.
我不能同意这种行为,更谈不上参与这些行动了

b) He is too shy to ask a stranger the time, still less speak to a room full of people.
他连向陌生人打听时间都不好意思,更不用说和一屋子人讲话了.

解析: much less, still less引导的词组或从句, 表示一种追加的否定,所以这两个词组只能用于否定句中.需要指出的是:to say nothing of, not to speak of, not to mention, let alone这四个词组的意思也是"更不用说",也表示一个追补的说法,但它们与much less和still less有所不同,这些词组可以随前一句的意思而定,前一句是肯定意义,则追加的就是肯定意义,如果前一句是否定意义,则追加的就是否定意义.

c) In old China, there was hardly any machine-building industry, to say nothing of electronic industry.
在旧中国,几乎没有什么机械制造工业,更不用说电子工业了

d) Sally takes singing and dancing lessons, to say nothing of swimming and tennis lessons.
萨利不仅上歌唱和舞蹈课,还上游泳和网球课.


13. anything but 根本不; all but几乎,差一点,除...以外其余都是; but for要不是; but that+从句: 若不是...
a) Alone in a deserted house, he was so busy with his research work that he felt anything but lonely.
虽然独自一人待在这所清冷的房子里,但他埋头于研究工作,一点也没感到孤独.

解析: 这是一个主从复合句.he was so busy...work是主句,that至句末是结果状语从句,句首alone...house为形容词短语作让步状语.句中anything but意为not at all,句中but作介词,意为except.

b) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation.  
科学研究的方式不过是人类思维活动的必要表达方式,也就是对一切现象进行思索并予以准确而严谨解释的表达方式.

c) It was all but impossible to climb back into the boat.
再回到小船上几乎已经不可能了.

解析:此句中的all but意为nearly, almost(几乎,差点儿)

d) he could find all but one of his books.
他的书全能找到,只有一本除外

解析: all but 意为除了...之外

e) but for the rain we would have had a nice holiday.
要不是这场雨,我们本可以度过一个愉快的假期.

解析: but for 作状语,句子的谓语可用虚拟语气


14. not nearly = far from= much less than相差很远,远远少于, 完全不
a) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match the growth of population, which means that we are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing food.
食品供应将远远赶不上人口的增长,这就意味着我们在粮食的生产和购销两方面正陷入危机.

解析: 这是主从复合句,非限制定语从句的关系代词which之前为主句,which引导定语从句,在定语从句中关系代词that又引导宾语从句.


15. cannot...too... 再...也不过分,应该,越...越好
a) We cannot be too faithful to our duties. 
我们必须尽力忠于职守.

b) You cannot attach too much importance to the matter. 
你应该十分重视这件事.

16. as well as = in addition  也, 和...一样, 除...之外, 不但...而且...
a) The Socialist Revolution requires a change of the superstructure as well as a change of the economic basis.
社会主义革命不仅要求改变经济基础,也要求改变上层建筑

解析: as well as作连词链接两个对等的部分,其信息重心在as well as之前的部分,因此,翻译时应先翻译as well as之后的部分,再翻译as well as之前的部分.

b) Revolution in the Maxist science means a moral as well as a material change.
根据马克思主义的学说,革命不但意味着物质的改变,而且意味着精神的改变.


17. more than+从句(谓语中含can或could):实在不能
some math problems in that book are more than I can work out.
那本书上的一些数学难题我实在解不出来

解析: 本句形式上是进行程度上的比较,但than引导的从句意义上是否定的.

18. ..., only to+动词:    ....结果却...
They have to pay for expensive seats at the theater, the cinema or the opera, only to discover, perhaps, that the show is disappointing.
他们花钱去剧院,电影院或歌剧院买价格昂贵的票, 结果却发现演出令人失望.

解析: only前为主句, only后为动词不定式短语,其宾语为that从句,作结果状语


19. Nor+because...不是因为......
Nor do I teach because I think I know answers, or because I have knowledge I feel compelled to share.
我之所以教书,不是因为我认为自己能够解答问题,或者因为我有满腹学问,非与别人分享不可.

解析: 这是一个主从复合句,nor do I teach为主句, because...,or because为两个并列的原因状语从句. I know answers是think的宾语从句; I fell compelled to share 是knowledged的定语从句.nor否定的是两个because引导的原因状语从句,这被称为否定的转移译法.


20. (There be) no + 主语 + but + 谓语 + 其他: 它实际上是一个双重否定句,翻译时采用肯定句的形式
There is no man but has his faults.
人皆有过

21. 主语 + be the last + 名词 + 不定式或从句: 绝不至于..., 最不...的
Breach of promise is the last thing that he is likely to commit.
违约是他绝不会做的事情

22. not...but... 不是...而是...
it is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other (case), differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the latter is much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than the former.
这并不是说面包师或卖肉的人所用的磅秤在构造原理或工作方式上和化学家所用的天平存在差异,而是说与前者相比,后者是一种更为精密的仪器,因而在计量上必然也准确得多.


23. had(would) rather...+ than... 宁可....而不...
I would rather die with my head high, with indestructible faith and profound belief in the destiny of our country, than live in humility and renounce the principles which are sacred to me.
我宁愿昂着头,怀着不动摇的信念,抱着对祖国前途的深刻信心而死,而不愿在屈从之下背弃神圣的原则而生.


24. if only 只要...就...
if only we work with might and main, the difficulties will be overcome.
只要我们大家全力以赴, 必然会克服困难.

25. only if 必须在...条件下才...
you could know your own language only if you compared it with other languages.
只有当你将本族语言和其他语言进行比较时,你才能真正懂得你的本族语.

# 第五章 考研真题长难句解析
## 第一节 表语
1. the notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. 
意思就是说人们没有发现海里发生的巨大变化,因为他们只回顾了过去相对较短的一段时间.

主干: the notion is that + 表语从句
其他成分: people have failed to detect the massive changes为表语从句;which have happened in the ocean为定语从句修饰changes;because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past为原因状语从句. 


2. One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occured against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand.
另外一个不要因油价上涨而失眠的原因是,这次涨价不像20世纪70年代的那次上涨,它并不是在普遍的商品价格暴涨和全球需求过旺的背景之下发生的.

global excess demand 全球需求过旺(金融类词汇)
主干: one more reason is that+表语从句

其他成分: not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices不定式作定语修饰reason,这里需要注意的是不定式的否定是在to前面加not; unlike the rises in the 1970s为插入语,它将表语从句的连接词与后面的部分分隔开来;it has not occured against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand为表语从句,主干为it has not occured against the background.


## 第二节 同位语
1. they gathered all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers.
他们尽其所能收集了一切数据,这些数据不仅包括表现数据和个人成长数据,还包括那些表现优异者在实验室实验中得到的实验成果.

词汇: statistics数据(可以使用固定词组: statistics and details)
achiever 获得成功的人

主干: they gathered all the data. 主谓宾结构
其他成分: they can 的完整表达为that they can gather; not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers整个部分是data的同位语.
with high achievers 作定语修饰experiments

2. During the discussion of rock singing verses at last month's stockholders meeting, Levin asserted that "music is not the cause of society's ills" and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to communicate with students. 
在上个月的股东大会上关于摇滚歌词的讨论中,莱文宣称说:"音乐不是引发社会问题的原因",他甚至还以他的儿子为例.他的儿子是纽约布朗克斯的一个教师,他用说唱音乐与学生沟通.

词汇: verse歌词,诗句, stockholder股东, assert声称, society's ill社会问题=social ill

主干: Levin asserted that+宾语从句 and even cited his son. 主谓宾结构.

其他成分: During the discussion of rock singing verses at last month's stockholders meeting作状语

music is not the cause of society's ills为宾语从句, a teacher in the Bronx, New York 为son的同位语; who uses rap to communicate with students为定语从句修饰a teacher.

3. Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of "double effect", a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects--a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen--is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.
尽管最高法院已经裁定医助自杀行为并不受宪法支持,但最高法院实际上支持了被称为"双重效果"的医疗原则;这个已有几个世纪历史的道德原则认为一个行为可能会有两个效果--一个想要达到的好的效果和一个已经预见到的坏的效果. 如果行为的实施者想要的只是好的效果的话,这个行为是被允许的.

词汇: constitutional 宪法的, physician-assisted suicide医助自杀
permissible 可以被允许的.

主干识别: The Court supported the medical principle of "double effect". 主谓宾结构.
其他: although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. 为状语从句;
in effect 作状语, a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects--a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen--is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect整个都是the medical principle of "double effect"的同位语

词汇: surgery 外科手术, sub millimeter亚毫米, accuracy精确, 准确

主干: There are already robot system. there be 句式
其他: that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery为定语从句,with sub millimeter accuracy为定语从句中的状语从句; far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone为accuracy的同位语.
