what if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have 
an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus?
如果我告诉你有件事你马上去做的话就会对你的大脑, 包括情绪和专注力立刻产生积极作用?

And what if I told you that the same thing could actually last a long time and protect
your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia.
Would you do it? Yes!
如果我告诉你它可以长期维持并保护你的大脑免受抑郁, 老年痴呆或是失智症等不同病况的侵袭,你会愿意
去做这件事吗? 愿意!

I would talk about the powerful effects of physical activity.
我所说的就是体育运动的强大效果

Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain.
And that can last for the rest of your life. 
简单地让你的身体动起来,就能够有对你的大脑产生即时的和长期的保护功效.而且可以持续一生的时间.

Brain is the most complex structure known to humankind. 
大脑是人类所知的最复杂的结构

So there is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are 
going to talk about today.
这有一个真实保存的人类大脑, 它会展示我们今天所要讨论的两个关键部分.

The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making,
focus, attention and your personality.
第一部分是前额皮层,就在你额头后面,对做决定,专注力,注意力及性格等至关重要.


I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it.
我遇到了如此神奇的事情, 它可能会改变众多人的生命, 我必须要去研究它

I did it in a completely inadvertent way. 
而且是一种完全"无心插柳柳成荫"

I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds.
我完全不运动,我已经长胖了25磅

it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable.
我花费了很多年才意识到这个问题. 我是糟糕的

I had no social life.
我没有朋友

I said, I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.
我再也不要这种感受,再也不要做一个漂流之中最弱的那个

And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all 
exercise classes at the gym
这个想法促使我走进了健身房,我的A型人格促使我尝试了健身房所有的运动.

I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. 
我尝试了一切, 我做了拳击训练,舞蹈,瑜伽,踏步教程, 开始的时候确实很难

But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood
boost and this great energy boost.
但我注意到每一次含税挥洒后, 我的情绪变得非常好,精力也很好

And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling 
better, I even lost that 25 pounds.
那促使我一直不断走进健身房,然后我开始感受到自己变得强壮,我感受更好,甚至减掉了那25磅

And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something 
that really made me sit up and take notice.
现在, 自我经常去参加运动后已经一年半过去了, 我注意到有些东西值得我坐下来记录.

I was sitting at my desk, writting a research grant, and a thought went through my mind 
that had never gone through my mind before.
当时我正坐在桌旁,写着一份研究基金申请, 一个想法突然从脑海里冒出来, 此前我从未这样想过

And that thought was, 'Gee, grant-writing is going well today.' 
这个想法就是,"天哪,申请材料今天写得很顺利嘛"

grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to
come up with that million-dollar-winning idea.
基金申请写作从来都不好写,它太难了,你总是绞尽脑汁,试图想出能够赢得百万美金的想法.

I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. 
我能够专注,保持我的注意力比以前的时间更久.

And my long-term memory, what I was studying in my own lab, seemed to be better in me. 
And that's when I put it together. 
我的长期记忆--就是我在实验室正在研究的东西, 显示也更好了. 从那时其我将他们联系在一起.

Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain.
Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. 
或许我所有的运动都在改变我的大脑.或许我在自己没有意识的情况下,对我自己进行了一项实验.

So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about 
what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. 
作为一个好奇的神经学家, 我去文献里查找现有已知的关于运动对于大脑的影响.

And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything 
that I noticed in myself.
我发现一项让人欣喜的且正在增长的文献记载,记载了几乎所有发生在我身上的事.

Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention.

And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was.
我所了解越多, 我就越认识到运动的魅力.

after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion that 
exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following 
three reasons.
经过几年对这个问题的专注研究,我得出了以下结论: 运动是当下你所能做的对大脑最好的最具有转化性的东西, 有以下三个原因.

Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain.That's going to increase your mood right now after that
workout, exactly what I was feeling.
首先:它对你的大脑有立刻的影响.它会立马提升你的情绪, 就像我所体会到的.

My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. 
我的实验显示,单个短暂的运动可以提升你转移和集中注意力的能力,这种提升可以持续至少两个小时.

And finnally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times
which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks 
that falls off the counter, which is very, very important.
最后,研究还显示,运动本身可以提高你的反应时间, 这意味着你在接星巴克杯子的时候更迅速,如果它掉下柜台的话,
这一点可以说是相当重要了.

But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after.
但是这些直接影响都是短暂的, 它们只能帮你一时.

What you have to do is do what I did. that will change your exercise regime, increase your
cardiorespiratory function.
你所需要做的就是像我一样,改变你的锻炼习惯,增强你的心肺功能.

Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise,
is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. 
在神经科学研究中最常见的发现是长期运动的影响,它能够单独提升你的注意力或是你的前额皮层.

But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your
brain.
但实际上,运动所做的最具变革意义的事情是它对于大脑的保护作用.

The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets.
你运动越多,你的海马体和前额皮层就越大越强壮

Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are 
susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline aging. 
为什么这一点很重要呢? 因为前额皮层和海马体是最易受神经退化疾病影响的两个区域,并容易随着年龄增长认知能力下降.

So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease,
but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to atually have an effect.
所以增加运动量,你不仅能够预防痴呆和阿紫海默综合症,你更能创造最强有力的海马体和前额皮层,所以能够更有效抵御这些疾病.

The rule of thumb is you need to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you need to get aerobic exercise in.That is, get your heart rate up.
首要原则是你需每周运动三到四次,每次最低30分钟,要包含有氧运动,这样能够让你的心率加快.

And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra
walk around the block in your power walk.
还有一个好消息是你不需要走进健身房办一张昂贵的会员卡.在你能力范围内在周边街区多走一圈.

You see stairs--take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobia class that you were 
going to take at the gym. 
如果见到台阶---就走走台阶. 这些能量的汇聚和有氧课程是一样的,就像是你在健身房上的一样.

It's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. 
但是知易行难

We're going to do just one minute of exercise.
我们来做一个一分钟的运动.

It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch
your neighbor.
名字是"我说你应", 请做我所做,说我所说, 当然保证不要达到邻座

five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left.

New move--uppercut,right and left. I am inspired now. you say it.
新动作--勾拳,右左. 我激情澎湃,请跟我重复.

I am on fire now. 
我在燃烧

I want to leave you with one last thought.
我想要和你们分享最后一点心得.

And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier,
more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases.
把运动引入你的生活,不仅仅会给你一个更开心的,备受保护的当下生活,它还可以使你的大脑免受无法治愈的疾病侵袭.

And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better.
从而改变你人生的轨迹,让它变得更好.

## 二十四. 人生经历

### 一. 描述一下人生中曾遇到的坎坷

1. Nothing is forever.And the time comes when we all must say goodbye to the world we knew, goodbye to everything we had taken for granted, goodbye to those we thought would never abandon us. And when these changes finally do occur,when the familiar has departed, and the unfamiliar has taken its place, all any of us can really do is to say hello and welcome!

   

2. People, by their very nature, are always on the lookout for intruders, trying to prevent those on the outside from getting in. But there will always be those who force their way into our lives, just as there will be those we invite in.

   But the most troubling of all will be the ones who stand on the outside looking in,the ones we never truly get to know.

   正如那些被邀请加入我们生活圈子的人一样。但最令人头疼的是那些站在外面向里面偷窥的人，那些我们从未真正了解的人。

   

   

3. It's an odd thing to look back on the world, to watch those I left behind. Each in her own way so brave so determined, and so very desperate.Desperate to venture out, but afraid of what she'll miss when she goes.Desperate to get everything she wants, even when she is not exactly sure of what that is. Desperate for life to be perfect again, although she realizes it never really was.Desperate for a better future, if she can find a way to escape her past.I not only watch; I cheer them on, these amazing women.I hope so much that they'll find what they're looking for, but I know not all of them will.Sadly, that's just not the way life works, not everyone gets a happy ending.

   回过头来注视这个世界，注视我身后的这些人，这感觉很神奇。每个人都是如此勇敢坚定，如此地不顾一切。有的不顾一切地想要出走，却又担心因为出走而失去。有的不顾一切地想得到所有渴望的东西，甚至连她自己都不知道到底想要什么。有的不顾一切地想要生活重拾完美，尽管她知道生活从未完美过。有的不顾一切地想要一个更美好的未来，如果她能找出办法摆脱她的过去。我并不只是看着她们，我也在为这些了不起的女人加油助威。我衷心希望她们能找到她们追求的东西，但我知道并不是所有人都能如愿。悲哀的是，这就是生活，并不是每个人都有快乐结局。

   

   

4. There're some times in life when you fall down

   生活中总会遇到低谷,而你觉得你已经没有力气坚持下去了,所以当你去学校的时候你也许会带上面具,假装一切都好而事实上并不尽然，你回到家后,默默地倒在床上而没有人在意你,你不必取悦任何人, 你就是你, 然后恐惧来袭, 你知道你每每走到家门口时的恐惧, 可能是因为你的家支离破碎, 可能是因为你怀疑你的生活, 可能是因为你不知道未来将要发生什么, 你害怕, 可能...可能是你担心人们会怎样看你怎样议论你吧, 我今天只想问你，你已经被恐惧麻痹了吗？你难道觉得你没有希望了吗？我不是来告诉你我理解你的痛苦的.我并不知道被谩骂是什么感觉, 我并不知道因为肥胖而导致了饮食失调是什么感觉, 我不知道有一个支离破碎的家庭是什么感觉, 但我知道心碎的感觉，我知道孤单的感觉, 而且我想告诉你痛苦并不会结束...于是你改变你自己, 你去学校的时候, 你说在学校每个人都围着我咒骂, 所以我也开始了咒骂...为什么！？因为那确实是一件很酷的事情,每个人都咒骂,我不想被别人忽略, 我想被其他人接受, 所以我开始了咒骂, 你去参加派对的时候, 每个人都喝酒, 所以你也喝酒...为什么！？你说为什么我周围的每个人都在做着了不起的事！然后你开始迷失自我, 你开始在一些转瞬即逝的事物上寻求安全感. 你开始在一些转瞬即逝的事物上寻求幸福, 你可以任由自己喝醉, 但是明天早上当你伴着头痛醒来时，相同的问题依然存在

   And you feel like you don't have the strength to back up. So... Sort of put a mask on your face when you come to school and...Pretend that everything's okay when it's not and you go home and...Lay in your bed when no one's looking at you. ==You don't have to impress anybody.  And you're yourself.== And fear comes in You know the fear that you have as soon as you walk into the doors of your house Maybe there's a broken home Maybe you have doubt in your life, Maybe you don't know for sure what's gonna be happening in the future and...It scares you. Maybe about.... You... Maybe you worried about what people think of you, What people say about you. Does that fear paralyses you and I just wanted to ask you today. Do you think you have hope? I'm not here today to tell you I understand your pain. I don't know how it feels to be abused. I don't know how it feels to feel quote fat and you get an eating disorder. I don't know how it feels to have a broken home. But I know how it feels to have a broken heart and I know how it feels to be alone And I just want you to know that it's not the end...You change yourself. You come to school. And everybody swore around me in high school. So I started swearing... Why!? Because it's the cool thing to do. Everybody swears. So I don't want to be left out. And I wanted to be accepted. So I started swearing. You go to a party. Everybody's drinking. So you drink... Why!? ==Why everybody else around me's doing the big deal! And you start losing yourself. You start putting your security in temporary things. You start putting your happiness in things that won't last. You can get drunk all you like But in the morning you're gonna be sober with a headache with the same problems==

   

   

5. Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going Was that I loved what I did

   有时，生活会给你迎头一击, 别气馁. 我很清楚那唯一使我坚持下去的就是





 

### (一) 如果人生再来一次你会做什么改进

### (二) 你人生中最看重的是什么

   1. Spring comes every year to Wisteria Lane. But not everyone remembers to stop and smell the flowers. Some are too busy worrying about the future, or mistakes they've made in the past. Others are preoccupied with not getting caught, or thinking of ways to catch someone else. Still there will always be a few who remember to take a moment and appreciate what spring has given them. Just as there will always be those who prefer to sit in the dark, brooding over everything they've lost.

      每年春天都降临在紫藤巷，但并不是每个人都会停下脚步来嗅嗅花香。有些人忙于担心他们的未来，有些人担心他们过去犯下的错误。还有人费尽心机夹住尾巴过日子或是逮住别人的小尾巴。但还是会有少数人记得花些时间来珍惜春天所赐的一切。
      
      

2. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, Sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists. Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable, Than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth ,until they've faded. But trust me, In 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself, recall in a way you can't grasp now. How much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future, or worry But know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind. The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing every day that scares you. Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements Stretch. Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone
   Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
   Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
   Maybe you'll divorce at 40,
   Maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken' on your 75th wedding anniversary
   Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
   Or berate yourself either
   Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's
   Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
   Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it
   It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own
   Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
   Read the directions even if you don't follow them
   Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly
   Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
   Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past, and the people most likely to stick with you in the future
   Understand that friends come and go But a precious few, who should hold on Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle. For as the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard. Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft Travel. Accept certain inalienable truths Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you, too, will get old And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young. Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble And children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out. Don't mess too much with your hair, Or by the time you're 40 it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy. But Be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia,dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal,wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts,And recycling it for more than it's worth

   1. It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has  always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And  today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna  be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!

### (一) 很多人都喜欢八卦

1. Yes, everyone loves a scandal,  no matter how big or small.   ==After all, what could be more entertaining than watching the downfall of the high and mighty?==    ==What could be more amusing than the public exposure of hypocritical sinners?== Yes, everyone loves a scandal, and if for some reason, you are not enjoying the latest one.Well, the next one is always around the corner.

   是的，每个人都喜欢丑闻，不管多大多小。毕竟，有什么能比看到趾高气扬的权贵从颠峰跌到谷底更令人愉快呢？有什么能比丑陋的隐私被公布于众更令人感到有趣呢？   是的，每个人都喜欢丑闻，如果因为某些原因你不喜欢最新的丑闻，没关系，下一个很快就要来临。

## 三十. 友情
I've moved about 20 times in my life. And each time that I move to a new neighborhood, a new city, a new country, 
在我人生中,我搬了大概20次家.每当我搬进一个新的邻里,新的城市,新的国家.
it seems to get harder and harder to sustain the friendship I left behind. 
我发现维持一段友谊,越来越难.
But right now, sustaining those friendships seems especially important and especially difficult.
可是现在,维持那些友谊似乎特别重要
So I'm wondering what is manageable?
所以我在想,有什么可以做的?
how can I keep those friendships afloat without getting overwhelmed? 
我该如何维持友情又不会过度刻意?
to find out, T turned to my two most trusted sources: data and my mum.
为了一探究竟,我找到了两个我最信任的资源:数据和我的妈妈
Now, since she hates being in camera, this puppet is going to be as good as it gets.
由于我妈妈不喜欢在镜头前,就把这个玩偶当做是她吧.
But before she weighs in, I wanted to look at the studies on how friendships fall apart in 
the hopes that I might be able to avoid some of those pitfalls.
可是提起她之前,我想看看研究显示友情是怎么破裂的,以防我以后会陷入这些困境中

according to one study, friendships often dissolve because of a lack of opportunity to meet, hang out and connect.
一项研究显示大多数的友谊会解体是因为缺少机会去见面,聚会与联系.
which may explain why, after a year of isolation, some of my friendships feel like they're hanging on by a thread.
这就可以解释为什么一年间的独来独往,有些友谊就像是挂在悬崖边一样.

the same researcher made headlines with the finding that we lose half of our friendships every seven years.
同样的研究也整理出了头条, 每隔七年我们会失去一半的友谊.

Now, before you start doomscrolling through your contact list, you should know that's not quite as
severe as it sounds
在你想要狂刷你的通讯录之前,你要知道,这也不是想象中那么严重.

over those seven years, the size of our friendship group actually stays pretty stable.
在那七年里,我们的朋友圈其实也蛮稳定的.

So if you have 20 or 30 good friends now, seven years later, you still probably have 20 or 30 good friends.
假设现在你有20到30的好朋友,七年后,你还是会有20到30年的好朋友,七年后,你还是会有20到30的朋友.

The catch, though, is that 52 percent of those faces will be different.
不一样的是当着有52%的脸孔会是不一样的

Over seven years, we will replace many of the people in our network with new ones.
在过去的七年里,我们将用新人替换我们网络中的许多人

As someone who has had to work more and more from home, the opportunity to go out and make new friends is pretty 
limited.
作为一个不得不越来越多滴在家工作的人, 出去结交新朋友的机会非常有限

it's a luxury I don't often have.
这是我没有的一种奢望

And the research on the formation of new friends suggest that this takes time. A lot of time.
研究显示在建立一段新的友谊需要时间的,很多的时间

A recent study found that you have to spend between 40 and 60 hours with someone before they can go from 
an acquaintance to casual friend.
在近期的研究发现,你必须和另一个人相处40到60小时后,才能从相识到普通朋友.


They get upgraded to a fully fledged friend around 80 to 100 hours, and get elevated to a best friend after you spend at least 200 hours of quality time together.
他们会升华至完全熟悉的朋友,需要大概80到100个小时, 而要升级成最好的朋友,需要花至少200个小时的时间相处

And the emphasis here is on quality time.
而其中的重点在于相处时间.

You might say 'hi' to a barista every morning or be polite to a coworker, but you 
wouldn't necessarily invite either one over for dinner.
你也许每天早上会对一位咖啡师说"你好", 或者礼貌对待同事, 但你未必会邀请他们去你家共进晚餐

I was feeling a little bit daunted by all of these numbers until I spoke to my mum,  who has a more optimistic
take on all of this.
我开始对这些数目望而却步, 直到我告诉了妈妈, 她对这一方面比较乐观

A friendship is essential in your life. 
友情在你的人生当中固然重要

How dose friendship start?
友情是怎么滋生的

The first thing is to know that person.
首先你要了解那个人

If you don't want to know these people, if you don't open a window of communication, you will never become friends 
of them.
如果你不想要了解那些人,如果你不打开沟通之窗, 你无法成为他们的朋友的.

you have to start.
你需要先开始

If you want to be isolated, you just shut your windows and look at them, and they don't look at you.
如果你喜欢独处,你就把窗口关上, 静静看着他们, 他们是不会看到你的

OK, so yes, if I really, really want to make a new friendship, I could go out and make the effort to make
a new friend by, say, knocking on my kneighbor's door, who plays really good music a bit too loudly
好,如果我非常非常想要一段新的友谊,我可以出门然后尝试去交朋友,比如悄悄我邻居的门,就是那个玩音乐很棒却又优点大声的那位

But what about my current group of friends?
不过我现在的那些朋友呢?

Are we all doomed just because we don't get the chance to hang out like we used to?
是不是就只能这样了,仅仅因为我们都没有机会像以前一样常常聚在一起?

I think yes, with the friends, the distance gets furthur and further if you are not meeting them.
我想是吧, 和那些朋友,那距离只会越来越远,如果你不再和他们相见

But it also shows you the ones that don't disappear because of the time or the distance.They will be there for you if you need them.
但这也会让你看到那些不会因为时间和距离而消散的朋友. 他们会在你需要的时候会一直在的

So the special friends. And his difficult time shows you who cares and who is good person or a good friend.
所以特别的朋友,这段困苦的日子会让人知道谁是在乎你的,谁才是好人或者一个好朋友.

I think she's right. I don't think there's a magical formula or a mythical number of hours to chase.
我认为她是对的,我不认为有一个神奇的公式或者神话般的数小时数可以追逐

This just takes time and effort. 
这需要时间和精力.

So if you'll excuse me, I have a good friend that I need to call.
所以恕我冒昧, 我有个好朋友需要去通话.


*******************************************************
I must say, this is my first time in Taiwan. Actually, my fist in Asia.
这是我第一次到台湾, 事实上事务第一次到亚洲来.
I've only been here for two days, but thank you for your invitation.It's my 
pleasuer to be here. 
我到这里才两天, 不过,谢谢你们的邀请,我很荣幸来到这里.

Before I speak, I've got something important to say. This is Ted, so they told me, to be
very brief and to the point, concise.
开始之前我得先讲件重要的事,他们说这是ted,必须简洁有力.

I come from a conference that was held in Doha, Qatar. 
我刚从卡达的多哈会议回来

At the international education resources network summit, one of the most important
conference in the world about education. 
关于国际教育资源网络的会议, 是全球关于教育最重要的会议之一.

And I've done in a couple of other times.
我之前已经参加过很多次了.

So right, Successful running around the world, everything was laid ouot for me?
所以说,像这样,踏遍世界名地,我好像一开始就得天独厚.

Not, I come from a small village in the north of Italy. 
但其实并不是这样,我来自北意大利的小村庄.

From a lower middle class family, actually to be perfectly honest, to European standard, pretty poor family.
我的家庭属于中下阶层,其实以欧洲的标准来说是蛮穷的家庭

and if I look back in my past, I realize that very few would bet on me.
回首过去的我,看起来将来似乎不太会成功

I was, you know, one of the losers, I was kind of a nerd.
我以前是所谓的失败者,算是个书呆子

And proud of it, it was fun, still I am.
而且当时我很以此为傲,现在仍是

But I mean, the school environment was really tough. You have to fight your way out.
我要说的是当时的学校环境很糟糕,你必须去打斗

When I stay fight, I don't mean in the metaphorical term. I mean, literally, fight.
我说打斗不是譬喻,是真的要"打"

And as you can tell, it is me, right there, the tough looking one that.
你可以看到这张照片,我在这里,看起来最凶猛的那个.

I was clearly the strongest and the biggest of the whole bunch. 
我是那群最强壮最大只的一位.

When I was 14, I had to decide the high school to attend.
我十四岁那年得决定去哪所高中.

And my teacher, he said to my mom, "Ms...I'm sorry, but your son is
not one of the smart kids,
那时我的老师告诉我妈妈:"很抱歉,你儿子不是个聪明的孩子"

He's, you know, kind of stupid, he was asking weired questions.
他优点驽钝,他老是问些奇怪的问题.

You should just send him to work. You know, don't bother send him to school. 
你该让他直接去工作,不要让他继续读书了

Certainly don't send him to Ginnasio, the toughest school in the country."
尤其不需要送他去Ginnasio,那些是全国竞争最激烈的学校.

I mean, ever so my parents have been obviously the awesome parents they are. 
不过显然我的爸妈是很棒的父母
They didn't listen the piles of nonsense. And they send me precisely to the school
that they said I'll never be able to make it
他们根本不听那些胡诌的话,他们就把我送去那其他人认为我绝对无法去的学校

And two years later, I was given a chance, I won a full scholarship for a very 
prestigious school.
两年后我得到个机会,一间非常有名的大学给了我一笔全额奖学金

In the north of Italy, closely to Slovenia, it's called United World College.
学校是在北意大利,叫做联合世界书院

its mission was to make education a force to unite people, nations 
and cultures for peace and a sustainable future.
学校的愿景是让教育称为整合人民,国家,文化的力量, 以卖相和平和永续的未来

Just like my previous school, same thing. 
这个愿景和我之前的学校一样

But this is my turning point. 
但这是我人生的转折点

In taht school I had amazing teachers. They were the best.
在那所学校, 我有最棒的老师

Because more than just teachers, they were mentors.
不止是知识传授者,他们还是心灵导师.

They were guides, and they were friends.
他们引导了我,也是我的好朋友.

they told us that we could be everything we wanted. We could do 
anything in our lives.
他们说我们可以称为任何想成为的人,我们可以完成任何想做的事.

if we believe we can do it, if we had a plan and if we acted on it right,
and making peace on earth was not a hippie dream, it could have been a reality.
只要我们相信做得到,只要我们有计划,只要我们去实践,即使世界和平也不是嬉皮士的梦想, 它可以实现.

So that gave me the vision and the strength to take on many challenges that have gone
through my life.
这拓展了我的视野,也赐予我力量,接受人生中的各种挑战.

It brought me where I am today.
让我得以成为现在的我.

if I'd listened to my teacher back in my previous school, I 
am probably sweeping the floor of the school by now.
如果我听从我以前一所学校老师的话, 我现在大概在替学校扫地.

But how many kids didn't have this opportunity?
但是有多少孩子没有这种机会

It's nice to say the success story of one guy.
讲一个成功者的故事当然很好.

how many people are stuck in the small town with uninspired teachers, violent classmates and
no hope on the horizon.
但有多少人呗局限在小村庄,只有无法鼓励他们的老师和暴力的同学,眼前毫无希望.

In the past of couples of years, I traveled extensively in many countries, many continents, schools, 
universities fortune 500 companies. 
过去几年我到了很多国家,跨州拜访了很多学校,大学,全球500强公司.

And I can tell you that my story actually is not my story.
我告诉你,其实刚刚说的不是我的故事.

it's maybe your story, it's story of thousands of people that I spoke to individually.
它可能是你的故事,是上千位听我演讲的人的故事

they came up to me and said, "I have the same thing, thank you."
这些听众跑过来跟我说,"我也有同样的遭遇,谢谢你"

And these are just the ones I spoke to in person. It's probably millions of people
or hundreds of millions people.
而这些只是来听过我演讲的人, 全球可能有几百万人,甚至几千万人都有同样的遭遇

This is a tragedy, right? Why is this happening?
这是场悲剧,那为什么这会发生?

And many people ask the question, are we preparing children for the uncertain future
that lies ahead?
很多人问,面对充满不确定性的未来,我们替孩子准备好了吗?

But before we can answer this question, I think we first must address two very important
issues.
不过回答这个问题前,首先有两个非常重要的议题要探讨.

the first is do we even know what we are looking for?
第一是, 我们真的知道我们要什么吗?

What's the purpose? What is education for?
教育的目的, 应该是什么?

Because if we don't agree what education is for, then we can never say we're doing a good
or a poor job.
因为如果我们对教育的目的没有共识,那我们就不能说目前的教育方式是对是错.

I am going to tell you what education was for.
让我来告诉你教育原本的目的是什么.

Education was created for making factory workers. See at the end of 18th century,
industrialization has the problem.
教育原本是为了培养工厂的劳工, 工业在十八世纪末,面临一个问题:

They really had a hard time convincing people to leave the open fields and come to work at a
factory with dark rooms, 10~12 hour a day, repeating the same monotonous mindless task, over 
and over, obeying every order without ever questioning anything and never complain about it.
他们找不到人愿意到工厂上班,工厂里都是黑暗的房间,还要每天重复10~12小时乏味的工作,不需思考,只需一直做,
听从命令,不能抱怨或质疑.

I mean you can see why they had trouble finding volunteers. I'm sure you
have seen the historical reenactment by Mr.Chaplin.
你就知道为什么工厂找不到人了,透过卓别林的影片

So they created something called public educations and placed you at where you are strictly 
seperated by a year, where you have to follow orders, never question authority and do just
what you're told.
所以公立教育才成立,公立教育用年龄把人区分, 在那里必须遵守命令,绝不可以挑战权威,只做你被告知的事情.

Sit down and shut up until you're told, otherwise just obey orders.
坐下与闭嘴,除非叫你做别的,必须完全服从命令.

We spent the first three years of our lives learning how to walk and talk, 
kind of useful skills I would say, and for the rest we're told sit down and 
shut up.
我们在生命中的头三年学习走路,说话,或者说所谓"有用"的技能,之后我们只能坐下与闭嘴.

And yeah that sounds like a great idea. I'm gonna do that.
这听起来实在是很好的主意,我很乐意这样做.

Just follow as exactly as instructed, never question authority.
只需要遵守指示,绝不挑战权威

I remember in the elementary school, one day the teacher told us,
"now children, whatever I ask, I want all of you to answer at once, understood?"
我记得小学的时候, 有一次老师跟我们说:"孩子们, 现在不管我问什么,你们都要一起讲答案,懂了吗?"

"Ok, So how much is six times four?"
好, 6乘以4等于多少?

And we all said "at once!"

See, for the purpose that we set out for two hundred years ago, the education system is doing 
fine.
如果我们追求的是两百多年前的教育目标,那现在的教育体系算是很好了

In fact, it's working perfectly, creating obedient workers.
事实上,目前的方式很适合, 创造乖顺的劳工

The trouble is, this approach is no longer useful.
但问题是, 这种方式已经不适用了

It was never humane to begin with, but it was economically advantageous.
它一开始就不人性化,只是为了帮助当时的经济

And now, it's neither. ==So are we preparing children for the uncertain future that lies ahead?==
可是现在, 连经济都帮不上.所以目前的教育体系能教导孩子如何面对未来吗?

The second problem is this: no matter the supposed expert would like to tell you Believe me, there 
are many of them, 
第二个议题是, 无论那些所谓的专家告诉你什么, 我相信有很多.

Nobody really knows what the future is going to look like five years from now,
但事实上,没有人知道五年后会变成怎样,

and let alone ten or twenty years, which is, when a child who's now in kindergarten will graduate
and will have to find a job.    
更别说十年二十年,幼儿园的孩子二十年后毕业找工作.

What about the rest? What about the hundreds of millions of people who are working today and 
who could be out of job,
其余的呢?更别提上亿正在工作的人可能会失业,

because they are displaced by robotics and artificial intelligience five, ten or twenty years
from now.
因为从现在起5年,10年或20年后,他们将被机器人和人工智能所取代

I hear that some guy wrote a book about that robots will steal your job.
我听过有人写了一本书,叫机器人会偷走你的工作.

You can read for free at the PirateBay. It's illegal. It's creative, commons open knowledge.
你可以在PirateBay上免费阅读,这是不合法的.它是创造性的,共同开放的知识.

So we only know one thing for certain that the only constant is change.
总而言之,我们确定的只有一件事,只有"改变"是永恒不变的

After all, Entropy is not what used to be. Change will always come and most likely at an increasing pace.
毕竟熵的意义和以前也不一样,改变总会到来,而且极可能会越来越快.

With this in mind, I think we must do three things.
知道这个观念后, 我认为我们必须做三件事.

The first, we must prepare to accept change, instead of fighting it.
首先,我们必须接受改变而不是抗拒它,

I've been afraid of changes many times. I didn't want to change school, I
didn't want to change jobs.
我以前常畏惧改变, 我不想换学校和工作

Let me tell you, whenever I was afraid to do something, I didn't want to change.
告诉你,当我害怕做某件事时, 我都不想改变,

Those are by far the most depressing moments of my life. Being afraid is not nice. It's
paralyzing.
然而那些时候却是我人生中最低潮的时刻,害怕改变并不好,它使人无法向前,

Because when you are afraid, you're afraid to fail.
因为你害怕就意味着你害怕失败.

You're afraid that, yeah, I would not make it to that school, I would not win
the scholarship, I would not be able to change up and find something else you 
know.
你害怕没进那所学校,害怕不能得到奖学金,害怕不能够找到更好的方案

They were right. I was stupid I couldn't learn.
他们是对的,我不够聪明我学不懂

It's a downward spiral.
这是恶性循环,像无底洞一样.

We live in a society that stigmatizes mistakes. We've been living in
where failure is not an option. 
我们这个社会把错误污名化,我们一直生活在不能选择失败的地方,

And that we should play safe. Study something that will get you a safe job.
Work for a big company, look for stability.
因此我们总是寻求安全的路,读热门科系才能找到工作,进大企业工作以寻求稳定

But you see, in the future of great uncertainty. Stability is the illusion of 
the unimaginative.
但是我们都知道,未来充满不确定性,稳定根本是假象.

Lifelong, I think we must move away from the idea that teaching is for adults, and learning 
is for kids. 
第二点是终身学习,我们打破"成年人就是教导, 小孩就是学习"的思维

Learning is a lifelong experience. And anybody can be a mentor, a teacher, or a friend to 
someone wlse. Or a guide. 
学习该是终身,而且任何人都能是心灵导师, 是传授知识的老师,朋友,或者是指导者


In our strictly individualistic society, our personal success is imperative. 
在这个极度个人主义的社会, 个人的成就成了必要.

So we have standardized tests, we try to get the best grades at the best school, so we can get to the best 
university and then we can get to best job, and outcompete everyone else, and be successful.
所以我们有标准化的考试,我们试图考最高分, 进最好的学校,才可以考取到最好的大学, 争取到最好的工作,并打败他人并取得成功.

But in a collaborative society, an accomplished individual is one that contribute the most,
both of their personal development as well as that of their fellow human beings.
但在一个合作的社会,成功的人应该是贡献最多的人, 包括个人成就和对群体的成就

When I was at school, I remember that the way I learned best was not when the teacher was talking, was when
one of my classmates would come up to me and say, "hey how? This is how you do it?"
我在学校的时候, 我记得最好的学习方式并不是老师在说教的时候, 而是我同学过来问我说,"你是怎么做到的?"

like in five minutes, we would solve something that in 2 hours of lesson that nobody understood, and I thought
why can't we just get to that. 
我们在五分钟内解决了在课堂上两个小时没人懂的问题.我想我们为何不能直接解决这个问题.

Those 5 minutes of peer learning and when I was teaching someone else, I was really testing my ability of understanding and reciprocating that.
用五分钟同龄人互相请教的方式学习,当我在教别人时,我也在考验我的理解程度以及表达能力.

And also it was much more fun and engaging.
而且教人真的很好玩.

And we need time to experiment to make mistakes, to teach yourself,
to teach others, maybe with interesting problems not, here's the vacuum.
我们需要时间来实验, 来犯错,来教自己,来教别人,也许会有有趣的问题,这不是真空.

Fun and challenging problems, and the process of discovery, just like they were saying "starve them, not stuff them." The speaker before me
当你试着探索,有趣且具有挑战的问题, 就像之前的讲着说的,"让她们渴望知识, 而不是塞知识给他们."

It's exactly right. Discovery. Learning is a process that happens when you're interested and engaged. Not when you're receiving.
非常有道理,好的学习过程是会让人很快乐以及非常投入的,一直接受讯息不代表学习.

This way, you foster an innate curiosity that is inside all of us.
通过这种方式, 你培养起了一种内心与生俱来的好奇心.

And finally I think we must develop a stronger culture of grit.
最后,我认为我们必须培养一个有毅力的文化

Grit means passion. It means perseverance. It means never giving up. The determination.
毅力的意思是热忱,持续力,永不放弃,这种决心.

So many people see my success story, and they wonder what's different about me.
很多人看了我成功的故事,他们好奇我有什么不一样.

Am I special? No. Do I come from a rich family?No. 
我很特别吗? 不是,我 家很有钱吗?不是

Am I some sort of genius? Nonsense, my teacher said that I was too stupid to learn.
我是天才吗? 当然不是, 我的老师说我笨到无法学习

So what's different?
那到底哪里不一样?

It's very simple, I had somebody who believe in me. And I never gave up. That's it!
很简单, 有人相信我,而且我从不放弃, 就是这样!

I can guarantee you from my personal experience. 
我以我亲身经历, 向你保证.
